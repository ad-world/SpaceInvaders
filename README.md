- Code to play audio was inspired by [documentation](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.media/javafx/scene/media/package-summary.html)

## Notes

- ~~I will try and resolve this ASAP (on piazza), will update this README if successful.~~
- You can run this app from IntelliJ or from the CLI. `gradle build` and `gradle run` work as expected. Prof Jeff is da best
